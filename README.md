# GDCL
Graph Diffusion Enhanced Contrastive  Representation Learning on Topology and Feature  Space for Community Detection


To generate the KNN graph, use `create_graph.py`.  
To obtain the pre-trained model, run `pretrain.py` to generate `premodel.pkl`.  
Finally, execute `v14.py` to run the experiments.

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Graph-Clustering/blob/main/dataset/README.md).
